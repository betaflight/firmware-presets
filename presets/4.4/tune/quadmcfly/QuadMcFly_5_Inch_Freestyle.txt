#$ DESCRIPTION: After quite a while refining a base tune across multiple 5 inch setups I think I've gotten a very robust starting point that is worth sharing. This tune is designed to be somewhat conservative to handle things like dinged props and imperfect motors, but still handle well enough to minimize prop wash and feel sharp and connected.

#$ DESCRIPTION: <br />
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br />
#$ DESCRIPTION: This should handle anything from around 650g up to close to 800g. Above 750g it might start feeling sluggish, but it should be a good starting point for any mid-weight 5 inch build. Only small adjustments to the P and D sliders should be necessary for most builds.
