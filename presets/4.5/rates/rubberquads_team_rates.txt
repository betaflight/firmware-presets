#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: #Rates from Team RubberQuads
#$ DESCRIPTION: This is what we like to rock on our sticks.
#$ DESCRIPTION: I (Volker) am a thumber so my center rates are pretty low to give me the ability to fly smooth and precise lines 
#$ DESCRIPTION: My race-rates are toned down at the edge (550dps) but the same at the center to allow for a seamless transition 
#$ DESCRIPTION: between ze flippyfloppies and racing/cinematic
#$ DESCRIPTION: Settek is flying hybrid so his rates are quite a bit higher around center-stickder_V_free
#$ DESCRIPTION: Be aware that we use a little throttle expo to get more precition where we need (want) it most:
#$ DESCRIPTION: my freestyle rates have it slightly over the hover-point to help with smooth, low flying and catching dives
#$ DESCRIPTION: Setteks mid-point is suited for fast cruising and my race-rates will keep my throttle output around 70% 
#$ DESCRIPTION: for a wider range which reflects my current skills.
