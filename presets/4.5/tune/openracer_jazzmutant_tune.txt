#$ TITLE: OpenRacer 5" 6S by JazzMutant
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.5
#$ CATEGORY: TUNE
#$ STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
#$ KEYWORDS: openracer, race, 5 Inch, 5 In, 5", JazzMutant
#$ AUTHOR: JazzMutant
#$ PARSER: MARKED
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune was specially developed by **@JazzMutant** for 6S [OpenRacer](https://github.com/OpenRacer/OpenRacer/tree/master) with 1900-2050kv motors.
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: ## Important notes:
#$ DESCRIPTION: - Be sure you're using ESC with bidirectional DShot support (BLHeli32, AM32, BlueJay)
#$ DESCRIPTION: - Select "Clean builds" filters option only if your build is perfect and props are always not very damaged
#$ DESCRIPTION: - Test your quad after applying preset by flying slow for 30 seconds. Motors shoud stay cool or slightly warm. Quad should sound clean
#$ DESCRIPTION: - **If anything is off, don't fly it!**
