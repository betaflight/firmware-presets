#$ DESCRIPTION: After quite a while refining a base tune across multiple 5 inch setups I think I've gotten a very robust starting point that is worth sharing. This tune is designed to be somewhat conservative to handle things like dinged props and imperfect motors, but still handle well enough to minimize prop wash and feel sharp and connected.
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br /><br /><br />
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: This should handle anything from around 650g up to close to 800g. Above 750g it might start feeling sluggish, but it should be a good starting point for any mid-weight 5 inch build. Only small adjustments to the P and D sliders should be necessary for most builds. This tune works well for me on both F4 and F7 processors at 8khz and Dshot 600. If you have a noisy ESC or ESCs with poorly designed input filtering you may need to drop to DShot 300, but otherwise it should be fine.

#$ DESCRIPTION: <strong>This tune requires ESCs capable of RPM telemetry (BLheli 32, AM32, or BlueJay/JESC).</strong>
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Suggested ESC settings are:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION:  - Timing: 23 degrees
#$ DESCRIPTION:  - PWM: 48khz fixed (May also work with 24khz and ByRPM)

#$ WARNING: This tune enables RPM filtering, Dynamic Idle, and Thrust Linear. I run fairly high Thrust Linear and Throttle Boost, so low throttle may be more agressive than some other tunes.
