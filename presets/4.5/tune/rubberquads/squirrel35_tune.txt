#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: # Base-tune for the Squirrel 35
#$ DESCRIPTION: Works just fine in combination with the squirrel filter preset
#$ DESCRIPTION: If you run bigger motors than the 3quack5 (1604/4040kV) reduce the master multiplier to 0.85 and raise from there;
#$ DESCRIPTION: If you run a small motors like 1404s you might need to raise thrust linearisation to 0.2 and start with a master-multiplier of 1.2
#$ WARNING: Please load the adequate preset for your control-link and hit save
#$ DESCRIPTION: otherwise feed-forward will not be happy
