#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: This is a 6S 5" racing tune created by antonig specifically for the 100Euro racing frame [www.100-euro-fpv.com] - a 6s 5" AUW=480gr quad with a stiff frame.
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br>
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: !CAUTION! This worked on various lower and mid-tier setups with various gear - the tune was installed at multiple race days on mutliple quads and all reported
#$ DESCRIPTION: lower latency, better feel and faster lap times. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - this tune is aggressive and will cause BURNING HOT motors on hot summer days.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br>
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune is based on various previous tunes and conversations with top pilots and BetaFlight devs. Thanks to:
