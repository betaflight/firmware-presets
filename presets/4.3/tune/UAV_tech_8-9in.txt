#$ DESCRIPTION: Information:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: Base tune for a 8-9in quad with HD camera, approximate weight 750grams.  This tune is good for 4S or 6S batteries.
#$ DESCRIPTION: The base preset assume you have your ESC set to 24K PWM (default).  If you are on 48K+, click the option above.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Also if you would like to use with the RPM filtering or Dynamic Idle, click the option above.
