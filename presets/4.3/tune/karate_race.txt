#$ DESCRIPTION: <h1>Karate Race 6S 5"</h1>
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br>
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: This 6S racing tune was developed with the help of **@ctzsnooze** around **@KarateBrot**'s [RPM Crossfade code](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/10757) allowing for a pretty aggressive filter tune, which is called the [Karate Array](https://github.com/betaflight/firmware-presets/blob/master/presets/4.3/filters/karate_array.txt).
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br>
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune works well on any quality airframes and has been flown on the Viper racer (where it was developed), BMS Js1, 533 Switchback, HGLRC Wind and of course **@limon**'s OpenRacer.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: <br>
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: It should also work on other quality racing frames but use at your own risk as it is an aggressive tune. This tune so far has won a good number of events, including the **2021 MultiGP International Open**.

#$ DESCRIPTION: <br>
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: ## Things to note:
#$ DESCRIPTION: - **YOU HAVE TO USE RPM FILTERING WITH THIS TUNE!** Failure to do so might result in fire ðŸ”¥
#$ DESCRIPTION: - Regarding DShot600: if your setup has errors in the motor tab using bidirectional DShot, change to **8k/4k and DShot300**
#$ DESCRIPTION: - Also this should be applied to a clean flash after you've setup your rates, swtiches, vtx tables etc.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - To test arm the quad with props on, it should **sound clean with no grinding**. If it passes that then hover test and check motor temps.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - **If anything is off, don't fly it!!**

#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: ## Second note... Radio links:
#$ DESCRIPTION: 1. Make sure your radio firmware is up to date using either EdgeTX or OpenTX
#$ DESCRIPTION: 1. Make sure your **ADC Filter is OFF** in the hardware page
#$ DESCRIPTION: 1. Go to the radio (RC_LINK) presets and apply the correct setup for your system and link speed
