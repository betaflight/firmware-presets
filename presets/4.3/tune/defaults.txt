#$ TITLE:  Tune defaults for Basic 4.3 TUNES
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: TUNE
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: defaults, reset, tune, pid, basic, default
#$ AUTHOR: Betaflight
#$ DESCRIPTION: Resets all Basic 4.3 Tune category parameters to defaults
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Overwrites all settings mentioned below to defaults.  The User cannot retain their previous values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Tune authors must explicitly set these values to something other than default, if needed for the tune.
#$ DESCRIPTION: DOES NOT reset rates, filters, rc_smoothing, and many other parameters.
#$ PRIORITY: 0


# THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS ARE CONTROLLED
# ALL WILL BE RESET TO DEFAULTS WHEN THIS DEFAULT IS RUN
# ALL USER PREFERENCES FOR THESE VALUES WILL BE OVER-WRITTEN
# IF THE AUTHOR WANTS A NON-DEFAULT VALUE, THEIR TUNE MUST SET IT
# BOTH CHECKED AND UNCHECKED OPTIONS CAN BE USED FOR THESE PARAMETERS

# Note: feedforward_jitter_factor is related to both RC link and flying style.

# reset here to ensure a prior whoop flash won't carry thrust linear into other tunes

#   HONOUR THE FOLLOWING "PERSONAL PREFERENCE" SETTINGS
#   THEY WILL BE RETAINED, UNCHANGED, AFTER APPLYING THIS DEFAULT FILE
#   THE AUTHOR MAY PROVIDE AN *UNCHECKED* OPTION TO SET THESE OR OTHER PARAMETERS

# -- Stick behaviour, endpoints -- 
# -- Deadbands --
# -- Airmode (should be on) --
# -- Level Race Mode --
# -- Runaway takeoff prevention --
# -- Crash Recovery settings --
# -- Turtle mode settings --
# -- Acro trainer settings --
# -- Launch control settings --
# -- Motor output limit --
# -- Motor protocol --
# -- DShot telemetry status (controlled by a filter set) --
# -- Throttle limit --
# -- Throttle curve --
# -- VBat sag compensation --
# -- Small Angle --


# ------ OPTIONS GO BELOW THIS LINE ------

# This is where the author includes options that require input from the User

# Checked Options are allowed only for values from the list above, e.g. different options for a throttle curve or throttle boost, or a 'spicier' tune.

# Other values may ONLY be included as un-checked options. Examples follow...

# -- Rates --
# One ore more un-checked 'OPTION' elements that 'Include' external Rates preset files.

# -- RC_Smoothing --
# One ore more un-checked 'RC_SMOOTHING' elements that 'Include' external rc_smoothing preset files.

# -- Filters --
# One ore more un-checked 'FILTERS elements that 'Include' external Filter preset files.
# It may be good to initialise to a non-RPM filter set, then provide your preferred RPM aware filter set as a checked uption.



# -- Throttle limit (default) --
# For least full throttle noise, use SCALE and values around 95-96-97
# Different throttle limit values may be provided to the User with Options
# set throttle_limit_type = OFF
# set throttle_limit_percent = 100

# -- Throttle curve (default, off) --
# Whoops etc do best with a concave-down throttle boost at low stick angle
# Different throttle limit values may be provided to the User with Options
# set thr_mid = 50
# set thr_expo = 0

# -- VBat sag compensation (off, default) --
# Most pilots find that full sag compensation is better than off
# set vbat_sag_compensation = 0
# set vbat_sag_lpf_period = 2

# -- Constrain arming within a limited range (default 25 degrees) --
# useful to be set to 180 to arm if stuck at an angle, increases risk of accidentally arming while being carried
# set small_angle = 25

# -- Set min stick values to default --
# in case changed to silly number and can't get stick commands to work
# both are better set to 1020 for digital radios with sticks adjusted to a 1000-2000 range
# set min_throttle = 1070
# set min_check = 1050
