#$ TITLE: FlyFive33 3in TinyTrainer 3S Tune
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: TUNE
#$ STATUS: COMMUNITY
#$ KEYWORDS: TinyTrainer, 533, Spec, Race, Llama
#$ AUTHOR: Daniel Appel / Tehllama && Armando Gallegos / Mondo && Evan Turner / HeadsUp
#$ DESCRIPTION: This is an adaptation of the 533 TinyTrainer tune, and expects bidir DShot ESCs at 48kHz PWM with MedHigh timing. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: These fly best on 3S batteries in the 450-550mAh capacity range.
