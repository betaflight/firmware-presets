#$ DESCRIPTION: Information:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: Base tune for a 6-75in quad with HD camera, approximate weight 700grams.  This tune is good for 4S or 6S batteries.
#$ DESCRIPTION: The base preset assume you have your ESC set to 24K PWM (default).  If you are on 48K+, click the option above.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Also if you would like to use with the RPM filtering or Dynamic Idle, click the option above.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If you don't know what these features mean, click the links below for videos on each topic.

#$ DESCRIPTION: - [RPM Filter](https://youtu.be/ve_TNB0D87U)
#$ DESCRIPTION: - [Dynamic Idle](https://youtu.be/2Mr-AP7K8YE)
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: Recommended motors for a 6″/7″ is 25xx+  |  Recommended motors for a 7″/8″ is 28xx+
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ WARNING: **DO NOT** select the RPM Filter option unless your ESCs support DSHOT and Bi-Directional Communication.  If you are unsure, HIT CANCEL and de-select that option, OTHERWISE it can spin up motors even before you arm your quad!!!
