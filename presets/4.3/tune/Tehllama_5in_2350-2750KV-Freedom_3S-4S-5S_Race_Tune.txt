#$ TITLE: 5in FreedomSpec Race Tune 2350-2750KV on 3S (Spec) and 4S/5S (Open)
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: TUNE
#$ STATUS: COMMUNITY
#$ KEYWORDS: 533, HighKV, FreedomSpec, Spec, Race, Llama, MultiVoltage
#$ AUTHOR: Daniel Appel / Tehllama
#$ DESCRIPTION: Built for EMULATING 533 FreedomSpec and similar builds on bidir DShot ESCs at 48kHz PWM with 23Â°/MedHigh timing
#$ DESCRIPTION: 3S (2200mAh) will run a spec tune.  4S and 5S will run a very conservative open race tune.
#$ DISCLAIMER: This tune will auto-select profiles based on battery voltage at plugin, but only for 3S, 4S and 5S packs. Extensive testing has been done across 54+ builds, however not every craft will run best on this tune.
#$ WARNING: Use at your own risk.  NO 6-cell tune or throttle limit is provided with this tune.  Plugging in a 6S pack with 3S profile active will likely cause damage.
