#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune works ONLY with bidirectional DSHOT 600/300. If your FC can't handle DSHOT600, pelase select DSHOT 300 in the options here.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If your RC link is anything different from 250hz, please use corresponding preset from RC link category on top of this preset. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: DO NOT try to fly this tune on any battery besides 3S!
#$ DESCRIPTION: Freedom spec: 3S LiPo, Headsup 1960kv 2207 motors, HQ R38 5 inch props. Minimum weight with the battery: 460g.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune prioritizes clean motor traces at full throttle to make sure your quad flies as fast as possible without loosing energy for heating the motors.
#$ DESCRIPTION: The less noise the faster your quad flies at full throttle. Make sure your frame is solid, all screws are tight, RC link/OpenTX/EdgeTX is up to date.
