#$ DESCRIPTION: Freedom spec: 3S LiPo, Headsup 1960kv 2207 motors, HQ R38 5 inch props. Minimum weight with the battery: 460g.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune prioritizes clean motor traces at full throttle to make sure your quad flies as fast as possible without loosing energy for heating the motors.
#$ DESCRIPTION: The less noise the faster your quad flies at full throttle. Make sure your frame is solid, all screws are tight, RC link/OpenTX/EdgeTX is up to date.
