#$ AUTHOR: sugarK
#$ DESCRIPTION: This racing tune was developed for the 533 TinyTrainer spec class with @Shames throwing his quad out the window of his office and sending me logs.
#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Things to note.. YOU HAVE TO USE RPM FILTERING WITH THIS TUNE, failure to do so might result in fire and regarding Dshot600,  if your setup has errors in the motor tab using bidirectional Dshot then change to 8k/4k and dshot300.
#$ DESCRIPTION: SECOND NOTE.... Radio links.. 1. Make sure your radio system is totally up to date using either Edgetx or Opentx and your ADC in the hardware page is OFF 2. Go to the radio presets and apply the correct setup for your system and link speed.
