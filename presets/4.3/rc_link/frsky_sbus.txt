#$ TITLE: FrSky Sbus
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: RC_LINK
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: frsky, sbus, rc, link
#$ AUTHOR: ctzsnooze
#$ DESCRIPTION: Basic RC link settings for a 111hz / 9ms FrSky Sbus link, with the Rx bound in D16 mode with no more than 8 channels.
#$ DESCRIPTION: These settings work best when used with a version of OpenTx with good module sync.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: Telemetry requires smartPort (s.Port) and does not convey RSSI (use Lua or analog RSSI).
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: When more than 8 channels are bound, manual RC smoothing settings and two point averaging is required.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Early versions of OpenTx with poor module sync will require two point averaging.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Cell vs full voltage option affects which value will be sent by telemetry to the handset. Default is per cell.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Units default to metric. Telemetry defaults to non-inverted and half-duple. Both can be changed with checkbox.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Other telemetry settings,eg gps format, default latitude and longitude, extra sensors, require manual CLI entries.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Other options are provided for the intended flying style.
