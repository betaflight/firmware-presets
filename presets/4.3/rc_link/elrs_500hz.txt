#$ DESCRIPTION: Basic RC link settings for a 500Hz ELRS link via CRSF.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: make ABSOLUTELY SURE that the OpenTx or EdgeTx Hardware ADC Filter is un-checked!
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Use a compatible version of EdgeTx or OpenTx!
#$ DESCRIPTION: If a log shows excessive noise in your feedforward trace, most likely there is a Tx firmware issue.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Sends single cell voltage back to the transmitter, unless you choose the whole pack option.
