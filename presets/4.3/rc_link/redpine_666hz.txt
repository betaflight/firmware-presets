# rc smoothing should always be enabled with Redpine
set rc_smoothing = ON

# sharper handling for racing:
#$ OPTION BEGIN (UNCHECKED): Race feedforward settings
set feedforward_smooth_factor = 65
set feedforward_jitter_factor = 4
#$ OPTION END

# stronger smoothing for HD freestyle:
#$ OPTION BEGIN (UNCHECKED): HD Freestyle feedforward settings
set feedforward_averaging = 3_POINT

# even stronger smoothing for Cinematic flying (not for racing):
