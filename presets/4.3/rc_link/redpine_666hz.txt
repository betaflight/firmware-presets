#$ DESCRIPTION: Basic RC link settings for a 666Hz Redpine SPI link.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: make ABSOLUTELY SURE that the Tx hardware ADC Filter is un-checked!
#$ DESCRIPTION: If a log shows excessive noise in your feedforward trace, most likely there is a Tx firmware issue.

# rc smoothing should always be enabled with Redpine
set rc_smoothing = ON

# sharper handling for racing:
#$ OPTION BEGIN (UNCHECKED): Race feedforward settings
set feedforward_smooth_factor = 65
set feedforward_jitter_factor = 4
#$ OPTION END

# stronger smoothing for HD freestyle:
#$ OPTION BEGIN (UNCHECKED): HD Freestyle feedforward settings
set feedforward_averaging = 3_POINT
set feedforward_smooth_factor = 75
set feedforward_jitter_factor = 9

# even stronger smoothing for Cinematic flying (not for racing):
#$ OPTION BEGIN (UNCHECKED): Cinematic feedforward settings
set feedforward_averaging = 3_POINT
