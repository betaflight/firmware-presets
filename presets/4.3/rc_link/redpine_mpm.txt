#$ AUTHOR: ctzsnooze
#$ DESCRIPTION: Basic RC link settings Redpine in a multiprotocol module for OpenTx
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: This is a slow link, effectively 140hz, not well suited to racing
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Be SURE that the Tx hardware ADC Filter is un-checked!
#$ DESCRIPTION: If a log shows excessive noise in your feedforward trace, most likely there is a Tx firmware issue.
#$ DISCUSSION: https://github.com/betaflight/firmware-presets/pull/148
