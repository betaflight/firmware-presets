#$ DESCRIPTION: Setup fo the various TBS radio links via CRSF protocol for freestyle.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: make ABSOLUTELY SURE that the Hardware > ADC Filter is un-checked! and both radio and the TX unit are all up to date with the latest EdgeTX, OpenTX or FreedomTX.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There are 2 current types of Crossfire protocol, CFV3 if your using a TBS radio and CFV2 if your radio runs Open/EdgeTX.
