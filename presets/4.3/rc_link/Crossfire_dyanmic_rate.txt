#$ DESCRIPTION: Setup for TBS Crossfire dynamic rate  CFV2/CFV3.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: make ABSOLUTELY SURE that the Hardware > ADC Filter is un-checked! and both radio and the TX unit are all up to date with the latest EdgeTX, OpenTX or FreedomTX.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Please use RC smoothing presets for flying style required. Note base settings are for racing, there is a check box at the end for freestyle.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There are 2 current types of Crossfire protocol, CFV2 and CFV3 this can be checked in your TBS lua. Also frankly we DO NOT recommend this TX setting, preferring one or the other of the locked modes as the RC smoothing can only be optimised for one of the frequency modes.
