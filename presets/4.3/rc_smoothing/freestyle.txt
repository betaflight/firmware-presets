#$ DESCRIPTION: RC smoothing settings for Freestyle footage.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Fixed cutoff frequency for consistent, responsive results over a wide range of RC link frequencies. Auto-smoothing cutoff values are over-ridden by the fixed cutoff values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There should be no need to turn off feedforward or to enable transition, beause the jitter reduction provides dynamic attenuation of feedforward whenever the sticks move slowly.
