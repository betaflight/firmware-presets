#$ DESCRIPTION: RC smoothing settings for racing that slightly increases stick responsiveness over defaults. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: this preset works best with a locked-frequency RC link. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Uses automatic cutoff adjustment of 25 makes faster RC links feel more responsive. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: If the sticks are too sensitive, increase the auto smoothing factors in the CLI. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: If motors feel warmer than usual after applying this preset, return the auto RC smoothing values back to default of 30.
