#$ DESCRIPTION: RC smoothing settings for smooth HD freestyle footage.
#$ DESCRIPTION: This preset uses fixed manual cutoff frequencies for consistent results over a wide range of RC link frequencies - the auto cutoff values are not used.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There is no need to turn off feedforward or to enable transition; jitter reduction provides dynamic attenuation of feedforward when sticks move slowly.
