#$ TITLE: Cinematic RC smoothing
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: RC_SMOOTHING
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: cinematic, rc, smoothing, rc_smoothing, jitter, transition, hd
#$ AUTHOR: ctzsnooze
#$ DESCRIPTION: Warning: will feel VERY 'soft' and smooth with small stick inputs!
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: auto-smoothing values are over-ridden by manually configure cutoff values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: This preset provides RC smoothing settings for cinematic HD footage. By using fixed cutoffs, it will give a consistent smooth stick feel across a wide range of RC link frequencies.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There is no need to turn off feedforward; it should remain at values that give good stick responsiveness.
#$ DESCRIPTION: For even smoother stick feel, reduce rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff and rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff to 10 in CLI.  If too smooth, increase rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff and rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff to 20 in CLI.
