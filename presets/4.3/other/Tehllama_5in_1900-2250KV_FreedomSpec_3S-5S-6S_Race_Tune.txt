#$ TITLE: 5in FreedomSpec Race Tune 1900-2150KV on 3S (Spec) and 5S/6S (Open)
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: OTHER
#$ STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
#$ KEYWORDS: 533, FreedomSpec, Spec, Race, Llama, MultiVoltage
#$ AUTHOR: Daniel Appel / Tehllama
#$ DESCRIPTION: Built for 533 FreedomSpec and similar builds on bidir DShot ESCs at 48kHz PWM with 27Â°/MedHigh timing
#$ DESCRIPTION: 3S (2200mAh) will run a spec tune.  5S and 6S will run a conservative open race tune.
#$ DISCLAIMER: This tune will auto-select profiles based on battery voltage at plugin, but only for 3S, 5S, and 6S packs. Extensive testing has been done across 54+ builds, however not every craft will run best on this tune.
#$ WARNING: Use at your own risk.  This tune does NOT have a profile auto-select with 4S batteries, which may case issues if Profile 3 (3S) is selected.
