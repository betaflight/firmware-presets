#$ TITLE: 5in TexasSpec Freedom Race Tune 2350-2750KV on 3S (Spec) and 4S/5S (Open)
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: OTHER
#$ STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
#$ KEYWORDS: 533, HighKV, FreedomSpec, Spec, Tune, Race, Llama, MultiVoltage, Texas
#$ AUTHOR: Daniel Appel / Tehllama
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune is intended for builds on bidir DShot ESCs at 48kHz PWM with 23-27Â°/MedHigh timing.
#$ DESCRIPTION: 3S batteries will EMULATE 533 FreedomSpec (3S 2200mAh) with motor output limits, and select the spec tune on Profile #3 that auto-selects with correct motor KV selections.
#$ DESCRIPTION: 4S and 5S will run a conservative open race tune on Profiles #1/#2 respectively, based on voltage plugged in.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Strongly recommend a full chip erase reflash if alternative tunes are desired.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Extensive testing has been done across 57+ builds, however not every craft will run best on this tune.
#$ DESCRIPTION: This tune will auto-select profiles based on battery voltage at plugin by default, but only for 3S, 4S and 5S packs. 
#$ WARNING: Use at your own risk.  NO 6-cell tune or throttle limit is provided with this tune.  Plugging in a 6S pack with 3S profile active will likely cause SERIOUS damage.
#$ DISCUSSION: https://github.com/betaflight/firmware-presets/pull/236
