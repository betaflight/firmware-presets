#$ DESCRIPTION: 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Options:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: - RACING: 500 degrees max rate with sensitive center (200 degrees). Has slight expo on roll and pitch with linear yaw.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - RACING HIGH YAW: Same as Racing rate but a higher Yaw max rate for those who find yaw control difficult while controlling throttle.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - CINEMATIC: Low max rate (450 degrees) with very smooth center (50 degrees) and high expo for perfect control. Higher center yaw rate for better throttle control.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - CINEMATIC CHASE: High max rate (900 degrees) with very smooth center (50 degrees) and high expo for perfect controlled chase with quick turns. Higher center yaw rate for better throttle control.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - SMOOTH FREESTYLE: Low max rate (500 degrees) with snappy center (200 degrees) and moderate expo on pitch and roll.
#$ DESCRIPTION: - FAST FREESTYLE: High max rate (900 degrees) with snappy center (200 degrees) and moderate expo for perfect control.
