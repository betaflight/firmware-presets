#$ DESCRIPTION: Information:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: FREESTYLE: 1000 degrees/sec for roll and pitch, 700 - for yaw. Smooth at center stick but still snappy at the edges.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: OPTIONS:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: - CINEMATIC/HD: Same max rates, but adds more smoothing (Expo.) at center stick for smooth transitions when you pass over stick centers (improved "skating" HD footage).
#$ DESCRIPTION: - WHOOP: For whoop racing in Angle/Horizon Modes.  Adjust Yaw rate and also Angle/Horizon Strenght, Level Limit and Transition.  It along with adds 0.5 Throttle Expo at the 45% throttle.
