#$ DESCRIPTION: the Karate fitler array as developed by @CTZsoonze and @sugarK for 4.3 using @karateBrot's rpm cross fade code.
#$ DESCRIPTION: NOTE this needs bidirectional Dshot support and RPM filtering active to use. DO NOT ATEMPT TO USE WITH OUT RPM FILTERING!
#$ DESCRIPTION: This filtering array will work with most 5" race and freesytle builds that have a solid airframe and motors in good condition.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Follow the usual process of hover testing and safely checking out your tune before using. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
