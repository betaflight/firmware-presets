#$ TITLE: 4.3 Filter settings for NOISY build with RPM FILTERING.
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3

#$ CATEGORY: FILTERS
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: rpm, DShot telemetry, filter, filters, noisy, basic, betaflight
#$ AUTHOR: Betaflight
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Ensure that DShot Telemetry is working properly!
#$ DESCRIPTION: Intended for slightly beaten up, or larger (7" and above), builds.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If motors get hot, try the filter Preset for very noisy motors.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If motors grind or make noise at idle, lower the D filter slider.
