#$ AUTHOR: Rogue FPV
#$ DESCRIPTION: This is my default settings for RC Smoothing when using Crossfire. I use these settings on all my crafts, from 4" - 7".
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: auto-smoothing values are over-ridden by manually configure cutoff values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: This preset provides RC smoothing settings for cinematic HD footage and hard core balls ripping freestyle, basically it's my "special sauce" for my style.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There is no need to turn off feedforward; it should remain at values that give good stick responsiveness.
#$ DESCRIPTION: For even smoother stick feel, reduce rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff and rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff to 10 in CLI.  If too smooth, increase rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff and rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff to 20 in CLI.
