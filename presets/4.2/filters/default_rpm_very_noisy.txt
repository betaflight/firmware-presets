#$ TITLE: 4.3 Filter settings for VERY NOISY build with RPM FILTERING.
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: FILTERS
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: rpm, filter, filters, filtering, very, noisy, very noisy, hot, basic, default, betaflight
#$ AUTHOR: Betaflight
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Requires RPM filtering - ensure that DShot Telemetry is working properly!
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Too much filtering may cause wobbling.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Intended for worn, beaten up, or larger (10" and above), builds.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If motors remain hot despite strong filtering, it may not be a filtering problem.
#$ DESCRIPTION: If motors grind or make noise at idle, lower the D filter slider.
